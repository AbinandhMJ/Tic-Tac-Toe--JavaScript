# Gameplay
- Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.
- There is no universally-agreed rule as to who plays first, but in this article the convention that X plays first is used.
- Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw.<br/> 
- Hence, tic-tac-toe is often played by young children who may not have discovered the optimal strategy.<br/><br/>
